The report assesses 18 leading WCM vendors for their ‘Ability to Execute’ and their ‘Completeness of Vision’ across their platform. The report provides insight that is useful for organisations that are evaluating digital marketing platforms to enhance their customer experience. 

Since the successful launch of Sitecore 8 and the Sitecore Experience Database (xDB), Sitecore has become the go-to platform for marketers who want to use contextual delivery and customer intelligence to deliver increased customer engagement. With the [release of Sitecore 8.2](http://www.sitecore.net/en/company/press-and-media/press-releases/2016/09/sitecore-launches-sitecore-experience-platform-8-2), tools have been introduced to increase the time to market for sites and frameworks in order to simplify data exchange. Sitecore has laid the foundation for an increased alliance with Microsoft which allows for native support of the Azure platform. Sitecore’s vision is to retain their position as a global leader in experience management software and extend the platform to become the leading digital marketing system.
